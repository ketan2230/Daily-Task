- What is PWA ?
    - PWA stands for Progressive Web Application. Let’s examine it by splitting it into two parts. The latter two words (“Web Application”) speak for themselves. PWAs are web applications. Here, web application simply means an app running as a website like, for example, Twitter. The first part of the term – Progressive – means that the user experience is enhanced gradually based on the browser’s capabilities. Essentially this means that the web application works well in older browsers but can utilise newer technologies to enhance the experience if the user is using a browser supporting them.

- Example of PWA
    - Twitter Lite
        - The most famous example of PWAs is the Twitter’s PWA version called Twitter Lite (try it with Android or desktop at mobile.twitter.com). Twitter has also published their reasoning behind building the PWA version. To highlight some of the facts from the post, compared to their native app, the size of the PWA version is only 1-3% and the average load time is 30% less.
            Other well-known examples of PWAs include Forbes, Trivago, Washington Post, Telegram, Alibaba and most recently Google Maps Go. There is also a directory of PWAs available.
